This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration. The bug.java file contains code that attempts to iterate over an array using a loop that goes one element beyond the array's valid index range.  This results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The bugSolution.java file provides the corrected code with the explanation of the error and fix.
